## Default interfaces (Part 2)

### Browse interface

We learned in the last section that the *Browse* interface is good for exploring our data. This interface is available here: [http://localhost:8983/solr/browse](http://localhost:8983/solr/browse)

SCREENSHOT HERE

This interface uses a special document writer which allows the server to respond to requests using [Velocity templates](http://velocity.apache.org/), creating a web interface to Solr without using an intermedia application. This particular template exposes a lot of functionality in a site which is suitable for proof-of-concept demos, but isn't suitable for production.

Most of the features of this interface are self explanitory, but there are a few things worth pointing out:

* There is an _enable debug_ link at the bottom of the template. If you click this, you'll see a few extra links on the page:
  * At the top of the page, below the search box, _toggle parsed query_ will show exactly what fields are being search, with what weights
  * For each individual document returned, there are two additional links:
    * The _toggle explain_ link will show how that result was scored for relevance
    * The _toggle all fields_ link shows all of the fields in the document
* There are tabs at the top of the page which help you to construct *Spatial* searches and *Group by* searches
* Any of the default search behavior can be overridden by specifying the override in the URL. For example, queries in the *Browse* interface will search a large number of fields (as you can see in debug mode, and if you want to limit the search to just the `feature` and `id` fields, you can enter them the URL like this: [http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/browse?&q=ipod&qf=features%20id](http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/browse?&q=ipod&qf=features%20id)
