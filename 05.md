## Default interfaces (Part 1)

Your Solr installation come with two web interfaces: the adminstrative console and the browse interface. The adminstrative console is good for getting some basic analytics on index contents and behavior, and the browse interface is good for exploring your indexed data and demoing changes you make in relevance or field behavior.

### Adminstrative interface

The adminstrative interface is available here: [http://localhost:8983/solr/#/](http://localhost:8983/solr/#/)

SCREENSHOT HERE

Many of the features on this page are out of scope for this tutorial, but on the bottom of the sidebar menu you'll see a drop-down labeled *Core Selector*. If you select `collection1` you'll be able to access a few interfaces which will let you explore aspects of your data and configuration:

#### Analysis

SCREENSHOT HERE

The *Analysis* screen presents an interface where you're able to enter example text and have Solr run it through the processes for a given field type, to see exactly what gets put in the index or exactly what gets searched when you run a query. The exactly functionality of this interface will make more sense later, after you've gained more experience with defining field types, but let's take a look at this complicated but familiar example:

Analyse *The King of France is bald, said the Knight's squire.* as a `text_en` field: [link](http://localhost:8983/solr/#/collection1/analysis?analysis.fieldvalue=The%20King%20of%20France%20is%20bald%2C%20said%20the%20Knight's%20squire.&analysis.fieldtype=text_en&verbose_output=0)

SCREENSHOT HERE

Here we see our query string as it steps through incremental stages of processing. If you hover over the row labels, you'll see the java classname for each process. The names for each of these is suggestive of their purpose, and you can find more details by searching for Solr documentation.

* ST - Standard Tokenizer
* SF - Stop Filter
* LCF - Lower Case Filter
* EPF - English Possessive Filter
* SKMF - Set Keyword Marker Filter
* PSF - Porter Stem Filter

It's worth noting that the order of these is important. For example, the Porter Stem Filter will only operate on lower case text. If you move into defining your own field types, this can be a useful tool for ensuring that you understand what is being indexed.

#### Query

The *Query* screen presents an interface where you can construct Solr queries, with access to the options that are defined in your `solrconfig.xml` file. This can be helpful as you get used to the syntax of Solr quering, which can vary because of the different programming styles of the Solr code committers.

The query results are presented within a frame, but the URL for each seach is at the top of the search response.

#### Schema Browser

The *Schema Browser* screen presents an interface where you can browse the fields that are declared in your `schema.xml` file and view information about how these are processed for indexing and quering, as well as information about what data is actually in your index, for these fields. The `text` field from our sample data is a good example to explore: [http://localhost:8983/solr/#/collection1/schema-browser?field=text](http://localhost:8983/solr/#/collection1/schema-browser?field=text)

Next let's look at the *Browse* interface.
