#Setup

Download Solr by going to [http://lucene.apache.org/solr/](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) and clicking the download button. Select a mirror site, and download either the .zip file or the .tgz file. Uncompress (unzip) this file into an easy to access directory, such as your home folder or documents folder.

Using a command line prompt, go to that uncompressed Solr folder. The files you see should look like this:

```
.
├── CHANGES.txt
├── LICENSE.txt
├── NOTICE.txt
├── README.txt
├── SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS.txt
├── contrib
├── dist
├── docs
├── example
└── licenses
```

Congratulations! You've installed Solr! (You can undertake a more [complicated installation](http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrInstall) if you're running Solr as part of an existing server environment, but this simple installation will suffice for this tutorial)
